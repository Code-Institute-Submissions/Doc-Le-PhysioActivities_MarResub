## Milestone - Final Project 
# Logo

# Intro
Physiotherapy Clinic website 
This idea originally came up at first as I'm a Senior Physiotherapist working in the field over the last 20 years. I understand the importance to have a platform/website that can provide information about the clinician and independence to make a booking/payment.

# Goals

⦁ Create a user-friendly, well-designed website easily understood 
⦁ Create a registration form that stores information about users in a database in an organized fashion. 
⦁ Create a login system so that the user has to log in to make an appointment. 
⦁ Make an appointment form so that the user can submit information about their injury as well as a day and time that suits them and see if the chosen clinician has availability. 
⦁ Create links to social networking sites so the user can find out more about the physiotherapist or write a good review on their page e.g.(Google, Twitter, Facebook) 
⦁ Have information about the location of the physiotherapist. 
⦁ Information about the different types of services the physio offers so that the customer can decide if the physio actually does that service before contacting.

We built a easy straight forward checkout to provide to the client the best experience.
Once the customer choose the clinician/date/time and is ready to pay, use Stripe.js to redirect them to the URL of your Stripe hosted payment page.

### Stripe demo/mock card

The demo is running in test mode -- use 4242424242424242 as a test card number with any CVC + future expiration date.


## Deployment

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps:

* Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
* At the top of the Repository (not top of the page), locate the Settings Button on the menu
* Scroll down the Setting page until you locate the GitHub Pages Section
* Under Source, click the dropdown called “None” and select “Master Branch”
* The Page will automatically refresh
* Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site Link in the GitHub Pages section

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the GitHub Repository
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Doc-Le/PhysioActivities.git)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Doc-Le/PhysioActivities
