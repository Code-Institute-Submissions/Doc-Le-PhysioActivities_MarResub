## Milestone - Final Project 
# Logo

# Intro
Physiotherapy Clinic website 
This idea originally came up at first as I'm a Senior Physiotherapist working in the field over the last 20 years. I understand the importance to have a platform/website that can provide information about the clinician and independence to make a booking/payment.

# Goals

Create a user-friendly, well-designed website easily understood ⦁ Create a registration form that stores information about users in a database in an organized fashion. ⦁ Create a login system so that the user has to log in to make an appointment. ⦁ Make an appointment form so that the user can submit information about their injury as well as a day and time that suits them and see if the chosen clinician has availability. ⦁ Create links to social networking sites so the user can find out more about the physiotherapist or write a good review on their page e.g.(Google, Twitter, Facebook) ⦁ Have information about the location of the physiotherapist. ⦁ Information about the different types of services the physio offers so that the customer can decide if the physio actually does that service before contacting.
